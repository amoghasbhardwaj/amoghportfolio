The COVID Bed Slot Booking System (CBSBS) provides a real-time solution for managing hospital bed availability, particularly during the pandemic. It allows patients to register, view available hospitals and beds, and book a slot online, ensuring transparent allocation and preventing queue-jumping.  

Key features include:  
- Admin, hospital users, and public login portals to manage accounts.  
- Real-time data updates using triggers to track hospital capacity and SPO2 levels.  
- Enables government and hospital admins to monitor available beds and patient admissions efficiently.  

Built with Python, MySQL, and XAMPP, this project ensures usability, error handling, and security, supporting hospital management in controlling the spread of COVID-19 effectively.
