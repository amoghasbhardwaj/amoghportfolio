QES (Quora for Engineering Students) is a community-driven question-and-answer platform, aimed at helping engineering students connect, collaborate, and solve academic and non-academic challenges. Taking inspiration from Stack Overflow, this project breaks geographical barriers by offering a dedicated space for students to ask and answer questions on a variety of engineering topics. 

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django with SQLite as the database, this platform encourages engagement and promotes knowledge-sharing within the engineering community. The user-friendly design ensures a seamless experience, empowering students to grow through collaboration and information exchange.
