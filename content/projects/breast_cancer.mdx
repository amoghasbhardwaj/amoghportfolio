The Breast Cancer Predictor project aims to provide insights into breast cancer classification, helping identify whether a patientâ€™s tumor is benign or malignant. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier, this project not only predicts the nature of breast cancer but also highlights the accuracy of each model, with Logistic Regression achieving 97.07% and Support Vector Classifier reaching 95.32%.

Driven by a passion for data science and a commitment to healthcare innovation, this project serves as a personal endeavor to impact lives positively. Utilizing Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, I began by importing necessary libraries and analyzing the dataset to ensure accuracy in predictions.

Focusing on key features like 'radius_mean' and 'texture_mean,' I chose Logistic Regression for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks, emphasizing the interpretability crucial in medical contexts. Model evaluation was performed through accuracy scores and ROC AUC metrics, culminating in the development of the `predict_tumor_probability` function to directly assist in making informed predictions about breast cancer cases based on specific input features.
