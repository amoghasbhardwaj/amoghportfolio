The **Jumping Box Game** is an exciting mini project focused on computer graphics, where players control a box as it jumps over obstacles, specifically green cacti. Using the keys ‘w’, ‘W’, or the spacebar, players navigate their way through a landscape adorned with trees along the track. The game features a dynamic weather system that transitions from day to night at specified intervals, adding an immersive element to gameplay.

Scoring is straightforward: each successful jump over a cactus increases the player's score by 200 points. However, be careful! If the box collides with a cactus, the game is over. 

Developed for Windows 10 and higher, this project utilizes the GNU GCC Compiler along with OpenGL for rendering graphics. It is built within the **Code::Blocks** IDE, making use of GLUT libraries to enhance the gaming experience. Whether you’re a fan of gaming or computer graphics, the **Jumping Box Game** is a fun project that showcases the intersection of creativity and technology.
